# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel

I'm an aspiring tech enthusiast, currently working on my skills in Natural Language, Java, Python, and Huggingface. I'm also an avid participant in the First Tech Challenge.

When I'm not coding away, you'll usually find me playing video games with friends or sleeping

In the rare moments when I'm not doing either of those, I'm probably making terrible puns. 

Thanks for stopping by!
